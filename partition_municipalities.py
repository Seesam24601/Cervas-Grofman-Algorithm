partition_municipalities.py

Created by Charlie Murphy

This file takes in a county_assignments dictionary and a graph of municipalities
and splits counties that need to be split by municipality. It returns a 
muni_assignments dictionary in the same format of the county_assignments
dictionary

# a failure

# For every county that is not split, add the unsplit county both to the
